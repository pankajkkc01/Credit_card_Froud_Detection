Card Fraud Detection","url":"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/versions/3","description":"Context\n---------\n\nIt is important that credit card companies are able to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions so that customers are not charged for items that they did not purchase.\n\nContent\n---------\n\nThe dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. \nThis dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.\n\nIt contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, ... V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are \u0027Time\u0027 and \u0027Amount\u0027. Feature \u0027Time\u0027 contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature \u0027Amount\u0027 is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-sensitive learning. Feature \u0027Class\u0027 is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise. \n\nGiven the class imbalance ratio, we recommend measuring the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.\n\nUpdate (03/05/2021)\n---------\n\nA simulator for transaction data has been released as part of the practical handbook on Machine Learning for Credit Card Fraud Detection - https://fraud-detection-handbook.github.io/fraud-detection-handbook/Chapter_3_GettingStarted/SimulatedDataset.html. We invite all practitioners interested in fraud detection datasets to also check out this data simulator, and the methodologies for credit card fraud detection presented in the book.\n\nAcknowledgements\n---------\n\nThe dataset has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group (http://mlg.ulb.ac.be) of ULB (Universit\u00E9 Libre de Bruxelles) on big data mining and fraud detection.\nMore details on current and past projects on related topics are available on [https://www.researchgate.net/project/Fraud-detection-5][1] and the page of the [DefeatFraud][2] project\n\nPlease cite the following works: \n\nAndrea Dal Pozzolo, Olivier Caelen, Reid A.
